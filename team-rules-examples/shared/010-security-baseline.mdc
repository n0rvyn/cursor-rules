## üõ°Ô∏è Security Baseline Requirements

### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use dedicated secret management tools (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Audit secret access and usage

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs at the application boundary
- Use allowlists rather than denylists for validation
- Sanitize data before processing or storage
- Implement proper encoding/escaping for outputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper password policies
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS/HTTPS for all data in transit
- Implement proper data classification
- Follow data retention policies
- Ensure secure data disposal

### Dependencies & Libraries
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency pinning in production
- Review third-party libraries before adoption
- Monitor for security advisories

### Logging & Monitoring
- Log security-relevant events
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Implement centralized logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Regular security audits and reviews
