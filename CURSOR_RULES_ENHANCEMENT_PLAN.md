## 📋 Phase 2: Content Optimization (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Rule Consolidation & Refinement

#### Consolidation Strategy
```
CURRENT STATE: 48 rules
TARGET STATE: 25-30 high-impact rules

CONSOLIDATION PLAN:
1. Merge Related Rules
   - 015-rule-logging.mdc + 008-evidence-first.mdc → 014-pattern-logging.mdc
   - 016-deep-debugging.mdc + 011-build-test-commands.mdc → 013-debugging-methodology.mdc
   - Multiple iOS rules → 101-ios-development.mdc

2. Eliminate Redundant Rules
   - Remove duplicate planning rules
   - Consolidate similar formatting rules
   - Merge overlapping quality rules

3. Create Composite Rules
   - 020-continuous-improvement.mdc (combines multiple improvement rules)
   - 015-quality-gates.mdc (combines multiple quality rules)
   - 019-team-collaboration.mdc (combines team workflow rules)

4. Split Complex Rules
   - Break down overly complex rules into focused ones
   - Create specialized rules for specific contexts
   - Separate general rules from specific implementations
```

#### Rule Refinement Process
- [ ] **Content Audit**: Review each rule for clarity and actionability
- [ ] **Example Addition**: Add 3-5 concrete examples per rule
- [ ] **Template Creation**: Create reusable templates for common patterns
- [ ] **Anti-pattern Documentation**: Document what NOT to do for each rule
- [ ] **Cross-reference Updates**: Update all rule references and dependencies

### 2.2 Content Quality Enhancement

#### Clarity Improvements
- [ ] **Plain Language**: Rewrite technical jargon in plain English
- [ ] **Actionable Steps**: Convert abstract concepts to concrete actions
- [ ] **Clear Examples**: Provide real-world examples for each rule
- [ ] **Visual Aids**: Add diagrams and flowcharts where helpful
- [ ] **Quick Reference**: Create summary cards for each rule

#### Template Standardization
```markdown
# Rule Template

tags: [category, subcategory, priority]
priority: [number]
alwaysApply: [true/false]
