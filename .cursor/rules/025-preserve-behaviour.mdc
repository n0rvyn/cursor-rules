## Behaviour-Preservation

- **No regressions**: New features or bug-fixes **must not break** public APIs or observable behaviour.
- **Minimal patch**: Touch only the lines strictly required.
  - Large rewrites are *prohibited* unless explicitly requested.
  - Prefer wrapper functions or targeted refactors.

*When unsure, ask the user to run the test suite first.*
