## Obsidian Community Plugin Standards

### Essential Compliance Checklist

- `manifest.json` fields: `id`, `name`, `version`, `minAppVersion`, `author` **must be valid**.
- Follow semantic versioning; bump `patch` for fixes, `minor` for features, `major` for breaking changes.
- Provide `README.md` with install, usage & changelog sections.
- Keep bundle size â‰¤1 MB and avoid native dependencies.
- Respect the [Community Guidelines](@Web "Obsidian plugin guidelines").

### Development Resources

- Official reference: [Obsidian Developer Docs](https://docs.obsidian.md/)
- Sample plugin template: [obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)
- API documentation: [obsidianmd/obsidian-api](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api)
- Utility for modifying core functions: [pjeby/monkey-around](https://github.com/pjeby/monkey-around)

### Technical Capabilities & Limitations

- **Core Function Extension:** Plugins can extend or modify most core Obsidian functionality
- **Third-party APIs:** Integration with external services is supported (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
- **JavaScript/HTML:** Full support for rendering custom HTML/JS in notes
- **Web Assembly:** Supported but rarely necessary for most plugin use cases
- **Electron Limitations:** Some features may be constrained by Electron security policies

### Best Practices

- **Performance:** Minimize impact on app startup and note rendering time
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Test functionality on both desktop and mobile platforms
- **Security:** Never expose user data to external services without explicit consent
- **UI/UX:** Follow Obsidian's design patterns for consistent user experience
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful user feedback
- **Settings:** Provide user-configurable options for customizing plugin behavior
- **Internationalization:** Support multiple languages when possible

### Publishing Requirements

- Check existing plugins first to avoid duplicating functionality
- Publish initial version to GitHub with proper version tagging
- Include these files in GitHub releases: `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css`
- Add funding information to manifest (optional): `"fundingUrl": "https://..."`
- Submit PR to [obsidianmd/obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) for community listing
- Maintain compatibility with older Obsidian versions via `versions.json`
