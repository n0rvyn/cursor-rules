## 🛡️ Core Anti-Hallucination Measures
- **Verify Information**: Always cross-check against provided context before coding
- **File-by-File Changes**: Complete one file before moving to next, ask for review
- **Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all file edits in one block to avoid fragmentation
- **Explicit Confirmation**: Ask before major architectural changes
- **Reference Existing Patterns**: Check @templates/express-service.ts before creating new approaches

## 🔍 Quality Gates
- **Limit Change Size**: Single modification ≤ 120 effective lines
- **Type Check First**: Ensure `mypy` / `tsc --noEmit` passes before suggesting
- **Test-Driven Approach**: Write failing tests first, then implement
- **Grep Before Create**: Search existing codebase before introducing new APIs

## 📊 Self-Validation
- **Chain-of-Thought**: For complex problems, reason through step-by-step first
- **Context Verification**: Re-read requirements before final code generation
- **Risk Assessment**: End responses with `SELF-CHECK:` noting potential issues

## 🚨 Immediate Stop Conditions
- If context seems contradictory or incomplete
- If multiple valid interpretations of requirements exist
- If proposed changes would break existing functionality
- If dependencies or configurations are assumed but not confirmed

10. **Token sanity snapshot** — Summarize context every 800 tokens to prevent drift
