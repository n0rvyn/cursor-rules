## ✨ Checklist Workflow
1. **After analyzing prompts**  
   - If no `DEV_CHECKLIST.md` exists in root, create it immediately with proper title
   - Break down requirements into tasks: `- [ ] <verb + task>`

2. **Every time code is modified**  
   - Mark completed tasks as `- [x]` + "✅ YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Add new TODOs as new unchecked items

3. **Section ordering**

```
### Features

### Refactors

### Tests

### Documentation

### Chores
```

4. **Historical record**: Never delete completed tasks.
