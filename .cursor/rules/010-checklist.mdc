## ✨ Checklist Workflow
1. **After analyzing the prompt**  
   - If `/DEV_CHECKLIST.md` is missing, create it with the title "Development Checklist"
   - Parse the prompt; for each task append: `- [ ] <verb + task>`

2. **Whenever you modify code**  
   - Tick relevant items `- [x]` and append "✅ YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Add new unchecked items for fresh TODOs

3. **Sections order**  
   ```
   ### Features
   ### Refactors
   ### Tests
   ### Documentation
   ### Chores
   ```

4. **Never delete** completed items; history must stay for diff review
