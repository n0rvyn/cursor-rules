# Feature Implementation Guidelines

You are implementing features and must ensure they are only added when explicitly requested. Follow these guidelines to avoid unnecessary feature additions.

## Feature Addition Rules

**Explicit Request Required**: Only add features when:
- Explicitly requested by the user
- Clearly specified in requirements
- Part of the defined scope
- Necessary for core functionality

**Avoid Unnecessary Features**:
- Don't add features "just in case"
- Don't implement features not requested
- Don't add UI elements without explicit instruction
- Don't create additional functionality beyond requirements

## Implementation Standards

**Stick to Requirements**: When implementing features:
1. Implement exactly what was requested
2. Don't add extra functionality
3. Don't include optional features unless specified
4. Focus on the core requirement

**UI Implementation**: For UI features:
- Only add UI elements explicitly requested
- Don't add decorative elements without instruction
- Don't implement additional interactions unless specified
- Keep UI minimal and focused

**Style Implementation**: For styling:
- Only apply styles explicitly requested
- Don't add animations unless specified
- Don't implement complex layouts without instruction
- Use existing design system when available

## Code Review Checklist

**Before Adding Features**:
- [ ] Feature was explicitly requested
- [ ] Feature is within scope
- [ ] Feature is necessary for functionality
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity added

**Implementation Quality**:
- [ ] Feature works as specified
- [ ] No extra functionality included
- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable
- [ ] Follows established patterns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Over-Engineering**: Don't:
- Add complex state management for simple features
- Implement caching when not requested
- Add error handling beyond basic requirements
- Create abstractions that aren't needed

**Feature Creep**: Avoid:
- Adding "nice to have" features
- Implementing future-proofing without request
- Adding configuration options not specified
- Creating extensible architectures unnecessarily

**UI Bloat**: Prevent:
- Adding unnecessary UI elements
- Implementing complex animations without request
- Adding decorative styling not specified
- Creating elaborate layouts for simple content

## Response Guidelines

**When Asked to Add Features**:
1. Confirm the specific feature requested
2. Clarify any ambiguous requirements
3. Implement only what was specified
4. Ask for clarification if needed

**When Uncertain**:
- Ask for clarification before implementing
- Don't assume requirements
- Don't add features "just in case"
- Focus on the explicit request
