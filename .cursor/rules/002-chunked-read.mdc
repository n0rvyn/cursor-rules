### ðŸ“„ Rule: chunked-read-200
1. Whenever you need to inspect a file, read it in fixed blocks of 200 lines:
   Command: `Read <file> L<start>-<start + 199>`.
2. Start from line 1 unless the user specifies otherwise.
   After each block, immediately request the next, i.e.
   `Read <file> L<prev_end + 1>-<prev_end + 200>`.
3. Continue until end-of-file, with **no overlap** unless user asks.
4. Do not show or request the same line twice.
5. Keep interim context only until final summary to save tokens.
