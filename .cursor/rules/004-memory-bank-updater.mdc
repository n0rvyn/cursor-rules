# Memory Bank Update Protocol

You are responsible for maintaining the project's memory bank with current development context. When requested to update memory bank or when significant changes occur, follow this protocol:

## Update Triggers
- After completing a major feature
- When architecture decisions are made
- After resolving significant bugs
- When new dependencies are added
- When coding standards change

## Update Process

1. **Review Current State**: Analyze recent changes and current project status
2. **Update Relevant Files**:
   - `activeContext.md`: Current focus and immediate next steps
   - `progress.md`: Completed work and known issues
   - `techContext.md`: Technology stack changes
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture decisions
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure all memory bank files are consistent with each other
4. **Document Decisions**: Record important architectural and technical decisions

## Memory Bank File Guidelines

**activeContext.md**:
- Current sprint focus and priorities
- Immediate next steps (3-5 items max)
- Recent achievements (last 2-3 items)
- Current challenges and blockers

**progress.md**:
- Completed features and milestones
- Known issues and technical debt
- Performance metrics and improvements
- User feedback and insights

**techContext.md**:
- Current technology stack
- Version numbers and dependencies
- Architecture patterns in use
- Development environment setup

**systemPatterns.md**:
- Design patterns and architectural decisions
- Coding standards and conventions
- Testing strategies
- Performance considerations
