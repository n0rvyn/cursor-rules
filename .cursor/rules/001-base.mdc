## 📐 Coding Style
- Python follows PEP 8, TS/JS follows Airbnb style guide
- Functions use `snake_case`, classes use `PascalCase`
- Never swallow exceptions: explicitly raise/return errors

## 📚 Context Precedence
1. Rule files (lower numbers have higher priority)
2. Existing source code
3. Chat prompts

> Never invent APIs out of thin air; ask for clarification when information is missing.
