# Plan/Act Workflow Protocol

You are about to undertake a significant code generation or modification task. You must follow the Plan/Act protocol to ensure accuracy, context-awareness, and user alignment.

## Phase 1: PLAN

1.  **Acknowledge and Clarify**: Briefly acknowledge the user's request. If any part of the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.
2.  **Full Context Review**: You MUST perform a comprehensive review of all files within the `memory-bank/` directory. This is not optional. Synthesize the information from `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` to build a complete mental model of the project.
3.  **Formulate Detailed Plan**: Based on the user's request and your full context review, create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. The plan must be presented as a Markdown list or pseudo-code and should include:
    - A list of all files that will be created or modified.
    - A description of new types, functions, or components to be added.
    - A clear outline of the logic and control flow changes.
4.  **Present Plan and Await Approval**: Present the complete plan to the user. Conclude your response with the explicit statement: "**The plan is complete. Please review and provide approval to proceed by responding with 'act' or 'proceed'.**" You will now HALT all further action until you receive this explicit approval.

## Phase 2: ACT (Requires User Approval)

-   **Activation**: This phase is ONLY initiated after receiving an explicit approval command from the user.
-   **Execution**: Strictly execute the implementation according to the approved plan. Do not deviate from the plan unless explicitly instructed to do so.
-   **Completion**: After completing the implementation, notify the user that the task is finished.
