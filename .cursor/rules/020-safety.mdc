- **Verify context**: Before coding, compare referenced files to ensure information reliability
- **No invention**: Only implement explicitly requested features
- **One-file focus**: Edit only the current file at a time, review before switching to next
- **Ask if unsure**: When uncertain â†’ ask first
- **Diff-only output**: Output complete single-file diff when submitting
