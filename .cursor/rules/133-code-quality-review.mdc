# Code Quality and Review Standards

You are making code changes and must ensure thorough review and careful modifications. Follow these standards to maintain code quality and avoid superficial changes.

## Change Review Process

**Before Making Changes**:
1. Understand the current code structure
2. Identify the root cause of issues
3. Plan changes that address the actual problem
4. Consider the impact on existing functionality

**During Implementation**:
1. Make purposeful, meaningful changes
2. Avoid superficial variable renaming unless necessary
3. Ensure changes improve code quality or functionality
4. Maintain consistency with existing patterns

**After Making Changes**:
1. Review the changes for completeness
2. Verify the solution addresses the original problem
3. Check for unintended side effects
4. Ensure code follows established patterns

## Quality Standards

**Meaningful Changes**: Every change should:
- Solve a real problem
- Improve code quality
- Add value to the codebase
- Follow established patterns

**Avoid Superficial Changes**:
- Don't rename variables just for the sake of change
- Don't reformat code unless it improves readability
- Don't add comments that don't provide value
- Don't make changes that don't address the actual issue

**Thorough Double-Checking**:
- Review your changes before submitting
- Verify the solution is complete
- Check for edge cases
- Ensure no regressions are introduced

## Code Removal Guidelines

**When Removing Code**:
1. Understand why the code exists
2. Verify it's safe to remove
3. Leave a comment explaining the removal
4. Update related documentation

**Comment Requirements**: When removing code, always add a comment:
```swift
// Removed unused import - no longer needed after refactoring
// Removed deprecated API call - replaced with modern equivalent
// Removed duplicate function - consolidated with existing implementation
```

## Implementation Standards

**Real Functionality**: Always implement real functionality:
- No placeholder functions
- No simulated implementations
- No TODO comments without actual implementation
- Complete, working solutions

**Careful Modifications**:
- Think deeply before making changes
- Consider the broader impact
- Test changes thoroughly
- Document significant decisions
