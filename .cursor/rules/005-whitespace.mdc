## Formatting guardrails
- Never propose a change whose *only* effect is to add/remove blank lines or other pure whitespace.
- Inside any block/function, do **not** insert more than **one** consecutive blank line.
- Do **not** add blank lines at the start or end of a file.
- Avoid trailing whitespace everywhere.
