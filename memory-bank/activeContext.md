# Current Task: Implement the Run Detail View

## Requirements
1.  **Trigger:** The `RunDetailView` should be presented modally when a user taps a row in the main `RunHistoryView`.
2.  **Data Display:** It must display the selected run's date, distance, and duration.
3.  **Formatting:**
    -   Date should be formatted nicely (e.g., "July 31, 2025").
    -   Distance should include the unit (e.g., "5.2 km").
4.  **Functionality:** This is a **read-only** view for now. No editing functionality is needed in this task.
