# Project Name: Stride

## Elevator Pitch
Stride is a minimalist, modern iOS app for casual runners to log their daily runs and track their progress over time. The core philosophy is simplicity and a focus on essential data, avoiding the feature bloat of other running apps.

## Core Features
-   **Run Logging:** Users can log a new run with three key pieces of data: distance (km/mi), duration (HH:MM:SS), and the date.
-   **Run History:** Users can view a chronologically sorted list of all their past runs on the main screen.
-   **Run Details:** Tapping a run in the history list navigates to a detail view (feature to be built).

## Target Audience
-   Casual runners and joggers.
-   Users who value simplicity and a clean, uncluttered user interface.
-   Users who are not focused on advanced analytics like cadence, heart rate zones, etc.
